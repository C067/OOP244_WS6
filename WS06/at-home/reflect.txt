Reflection:

1. The reason why the copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before 
doing anything else is because we need to see that the object that we are copying
are not the same. If the information is the same, we do not really need to copy over 
any information. If the object is not equal to the current object (&object != this)
then we can overide the current data and copy over the new one. 

2. In this lab I avoided duplication of code by using the function isEmpty() and a 
new function named SES(). The purpose of isEmpty() is to check to see if the data 
members are in a Safe Empty State. We can ask to see if the object is in a Safe Empty
State by using isEmpty() instead of checking manually. The purpose of the new function 
automatically puts the object into a Safe Empty State when called. 

3. By doing this workshop, I have learned the use of assigning a specific piece of data with
a specific size in order to decrease memory allocation. By assigning a specifc size to 
a new data member, we are able to decrease the size of memory used.
